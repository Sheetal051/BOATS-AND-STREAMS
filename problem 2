Q: A man can row 9(1/3) km/hr in still water. He finds that it takes thrice as much time to row upstream as to row downstream (same distance). Find the speed of the current.
A. 3(1/3) km/hr
B. 1(1/4) km/hr
C. 4(2/3) km/hr
D. 3[1/9] km/hr
Ans:
First, let's define some variables:

Let S be the speed of the boatman in still water.
Let C be the speed of the current.
When the boatman rows downstream, his effective speed is the sum of his speed in still water and the current's speed. So, the downstream speed is (S + C) km/hr.

When the boatman rows upstream, his effective speed is the difference between his speed in still water and the current's speed. So, the upstream speed is (S - C) km/hr.

The problem states that it takes thrice as much time to row upstream as to row downstream for the same distance. We can write this relationship as:
(S + C) / (S - C) = 3

Now, we can solve for the speed of the current (C) using algebraic manipulation:
(S + C) = 3(S - C) S + C = 3S - 3C 4C = 2S C = S/2

This means that the speed of the current is half the speed of the boatman in still water.

Since the speed of the current is half the speed of the boatman in still water, and the man can row 9(1/3) km/hr in still water, the speed of the current is:

C = S/2 = (9(1/3))/2 = 4(2/3) km/hr

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
