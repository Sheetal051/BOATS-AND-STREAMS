Q: A boat running upstream takes 9 hours 48 minutes to cover a certain distance, while it takes 7 hours to cover the same distance running downstream. What is the ratio between the speed of the boat and speed of the water current respectively?
A. 5:2
B. 7:4
C. 6:1
D. 8:3
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the speed of the boat be x km/h and the speed of the water current be y km/h.

When the boat is running upstream, its effective speed is (x - y) km/h. When the boat is running downstream, its effective speed is (x + y) km/h.

The time taken to cover the same distance upstream is 9 hours 48 minutes, which is equal to 9.8 hours. The time taken to cover the same distance downstream is 7 hours.

Let the distance be d km. Then, we can set up the following equations:
d / (x - y) = 9.8... (1) d / (x + y) = 7... (2)

Now, we can divide equation (1) by equation (2) to eliminate d:
(x + y) / (x - y) = 7 / 9.8 (x + y) / (x - y) = 0.714

Cross-multiply and simplify:
0.714x - 0.714y = x + y 0.286x = 1.714y x = 6y

Now, we can find the ratio of the speed of the boat to the speed of the water current:
x : y = 6y : y = 6 : 1

So, the correct answer is:

C. 6:1
