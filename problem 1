Q: A boatman can row a certain distance down the stream in 2 hours and can row the same distance up the stream in 3 hours. If the velocity of the stream is 4km/hr, what is the speed of the boat in still water?
A. 12km/hr
A. 40km/hr
B. 20km/hr
C. 8km/hr
Ans:
To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the boatman's speed in still water is the average of his speed when going downstream and upstream.

Let's denote the speed of the boat in still water as $b$.

The speed of the boat going downstream is $b + 4$ (because the stream is going in the same direction as the boat). The speed of the boat going upstream is $b - 4$ (because the stream is going against the direction of the boat).

Given that the boatman can cover the same distance in 2 hours downstream and 3 hours upstream, we can write the following equations:
$2(b + 4) = d$ (distance) $3(b - 4) = d$ (distance)

Since the distance is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions:
$2(b + 4) = 3(b - 4)$

Solving this equation for $b$, we get:
$b = 20$ km/hr

Therefore, the speed of the boat in still water is 20 km/hr (option B).
