Q:Speed of a boat in standing water is 9 kmph and the speed of the stream is 1.5 kmph. A man rows to a place at a distance of 105 km and comes back to the starting point. The total time taken by him is:
A. 16 hours
B. 18 hours
C. 20 hours
D. 24 hours
Ans:
Let's first find the speed of the boat with respect to the water in both directions:

Upstream (against the current): (9 - 1.5) km/h = 7.5 km/h
Downstream (with the current): (9 + 1.5) km/h = 10.5 km/h

Now, let's find the time taken for each leg of the journey:

Time taken to row to the place (upstream): 105 km / 7.5 km/h = 14 hours
Time taken to row back to the starting point (downstream): 105 km / 10.5 km/h â‰ˆ 10 hours

Now, let's find the total time taken for the entire journey:
Total time = Time taken to row to the place + Time taken to row back = 14 hours + 10 hours = 24 hours

So, the correct answer is:
D. 24 hours
