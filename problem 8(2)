Q:If a man rows at the rate of 5 kmph in still water and his rate against the current is 3.5 kmph. then the man's rate along the current is
A. 4.25 kmph
B. 6 kmph
C. 6.5 kmph
D. 8.5 kmph
Ans:
Let's break it down step by step:

The man's rate in still water is 5 kmph. This means his rowing speed is 5 kmph.

When he rows against the current, his effective speed is reduced to 3.5 kmph. This means the current is opposing his motion, so we need to subtract the current's speed from his rowing speed to get his effective speed against the current.

Let the speed of the current be x kmph. Then, we can set up the equation:
5 kmph (rowing speed) - x kmph (current speed) = 3.5 kmph (effective speed against current)

Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 1.5 kmph (speed of the current)

Now, when the man rows along the current, his effective speed will be the sum of his rowing speed and the current's speed:
Effective speed along the current = Rowing speed + Current speed = 5 kmph + 1.5 kmph = 6.5 kmph

So, the correct answer is:

C. 6.5 kmph
