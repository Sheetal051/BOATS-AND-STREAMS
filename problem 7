Q:In one hour, a boat goes 11 km/hr along the stream and 5 km/hr against the stream. The speed of the boat in still water (in km/hr) is:
A. 3km/hr
B. 5km/hr
C. 8km/hr
D. 9km/hr
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step!

Let the speed of the boat in still water be B km/h and the speed of the water current be S km/h.

When the boat is moving along the stream, its effective speed is (B + S) km/h. When the boat is moving against the stream, its effective speed is (B - S) km/h.

We are given that the boat travels 11 km in 1 hour along the stream, so its effective speed along the stream is 11 km/h. We are also given that the boat travels 5 km in 1 hour against the stream, so its effective speed against the stream is 5 km/h.

Now, we can set up the following equations:

B + S = 11... (1) B - S = 5... (2)

Add equation (1) and equation (2) to eliminate S:

2B = 16 B = 8

So, the speed of the boat in still water is 8 km/h.

The correct answer is:

C. 8 km/hr
