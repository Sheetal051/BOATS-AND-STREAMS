Q:. A motorboat travels 16 km in 2 hours against the flow of river and travels next 8 km along the flow of the river in 20 minutes. How long will it take motorboat to travel 48 km in still water?
A. 2.5 hours
B. 3 hours
C. 3.5 hours
D. 4 hours
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step!

First, let's find the speed of the motorboat in still water. To do this, we need to find its speed against the flow of the river and along the flow of the river.

Against the flow of the river: Distance = 16 km Time = 2 hours Speed = Distance / Time = 16 km / 2 hours = 8 km/h

Along the flow of the river: Distance = 8 km Time = 20 minutes = 1/3 hour (convert minutes to hours) Speed = Distance / Time = 8 km / (1/3 hour) = 24 km/h

Now, let's find the speed of the motorboat in still water. Let's call this speed "v". Since the speed against the flow of the river is 8 km/h, the speed of the river's flow is half of the difference between the speeds along and against the flow:
Speed of river's flow = (24 km/h - 8 km/h) / 2 = 8 km/h

So, the speed of the motorboat in still water is: v = (Speed along the flow + Speed against the flow) / 2 = (24 km/h + 8 km/h) / 2 = 16 km/h

Now, we need to find the time it takes to travel 48 km in still water: Time = Distance / Speed = 48 km / 16 km/h = 3 hours

Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 3 hours
